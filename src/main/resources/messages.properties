NotBlank.restaurant.name=must not be blank, dude

# There are many options on this file.
# The example above is the most specific way to determine a property's message.
# One could also use some of the options below:

# In this example, {0} translates to the property name.
#NotBlank={0} must not be blank, dude.
# It's possible to translate property names here too. In this example I'm camel-casing the 'name' property.
#name=Name

# One could also be specific, like so:
#restaurant.name=Name of the Restaurant

# Finally, in this example, I'm addressing every property called 'name' with a NotBlank problem
#NotBlank.name=A name must be provided.
